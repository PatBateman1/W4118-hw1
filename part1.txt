Part 1(a)
=========

1.  What actions does a kernel perform to context switch between processes?

/* TODO */


2.  What process state does a process enter immediately after it terminates?
    What is this state for, and when does it leave this state?

/* TODO */


Part 1(b)
=========

3.  What is typeof? Is it a C language keyword, function, or macro? What does
    it do?

/* TODO */


4.  What is offsetof? Is it a keyword, function, or macro? What does it do?

/* TODO */


5.  What does the container_of() macro do?

/* TODO */


6.  The container_of() macro, in the way itâ€™s currently written, is not
    portable across C compilers because it uses GNU-specific language
    extensions. Can you identify what they are?

/* TODO */


7.  The container_of() macro has two lines. Is the 1st line (the declaration of
    __mptr) really necessary? Is it possible to rewrite the macro without it?
    What is the purpose of that 1st line?

/* TODO */
