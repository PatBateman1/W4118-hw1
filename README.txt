 part 2: use build-in macro to traverse the linked list to print, for deletion: 
 use build in macro to delete the node from the linked list and use build-in 
 macro to get the pointer and use kfree to free the memory.

 part 3: the logic is the same, use pointer manipulation to replace the build-in macros.

 part 4: use dfs to traverse the tree. the traverse_list function has two parameters, the 
 node parameter is the head of the linked list and in the function, I traverse sibling, in each
 iteration, use the children to get the head of the children linked list head and do it recursively.
 the second parameter is depth, which is the depth of the tree and I use to to control the white space
 in the print_task function which print the pid and process name and the structure to the terminal.
